# Comparison Operators
"""
With the comaprison operators, we will compare the values
Operations: Equal To(==), Less Than Equal To (<=), Less Than (<), Greater Than Equal To (>=), Greater Than (>), Not Equal To (!=)

The comparison will always return in bool i.e. whether the given scenario is True or False.
